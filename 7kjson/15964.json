And if you look closely at your bill it states that $2 goes to the Texas Automobile Burglary and Theft Prevention Authority. But over the years, Texas lawmakers have decided to put more than a dollar of that money into the state's general revenue. \"We're getting less than one-third of what is now collected for the authority,\" said Lieutenant Tommy Hansen with the Galveston County Sheriff's Department. The money is used to fund auto theft task forces that work in conjunction with each other all over the state. \"These task forces since the beginning have recovered approximately $12 billion in recovered property,\" Hansen said. \"Every form of major crime involves a stolen vehicle,\" said Hardin. Task force members say while their funding has remained stagnant auto thieves have become more sophisticated. \"There are professional car burglary rings that break into cars to strictly steal personal information,\" Hardin said. \"They create fraudulent ID's and drain people's bank accounts.\" Task force members say not only are they not getting the funding they say they're entitled to, they're worried about talks in Austin of budget cuts. A house budget committee is considering a 4 percent cut for the task force. A senate budget committee is considering a whopping 10 percent cut. \"If we lose 10 percent of our budget that's 10 percent of my manpower I have to cut,\" said Hardin. Task force members say taxpayers should be concerned. \"Your insurance rates are going to go up your frauds are going to go up your burglaries of motor vehicles are going to go up,\" said Lieutenant Hal Barrow with the Galveston County Auto Crimes Task Force.",

          "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - As a budget shortfall in Texas threatens cuts to colleges and Medicaid, a costly border security operation is proving largely untouchable despite President Donald Trump's promises to build a wall and the plunging number of people caught illegally entering the U.S. A prolonged oil slump has left lawmakers about $6 billion short of the money needed to keep the status quo in Texas, which attracts about a million new residents every two years. But border security is one area where Republicans - who control state government - have all but refused to search for savings. During a key budget vote on Thursday, House Democrats proposed taking dollars earmarked for hundreds of state troopers on the Texas-Mexico border and National Guard patrols, and putting that money instead toward other programs they say are underfunded. One even proposed tacking onto a $218 billion spending bill a prohibition against using state funds on Trump's border wall. But the proposals to scale back Texas' $800 million border operation appeared largely symbolic during a marathon debate in the GOP-controlled Legislature. Illegal border crossings have plummeted in recent months. In March, authorities caught 12,193 people at the southern border - the lowest monthly figure in at least 17 years, and the second straight month that border arrests sharply dropped. Still, Republican officials from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on down embrace Trump's plans to build a wall, and the state is committing more money to border security efforts. \"At the federal level, the money hasn't been turned loose to apply the new resources that are needed to do what President Trump has said needs to be done, and what I agree needs to be done,\" said Republican Rep. Matt Schaefer, a U.S. Navy reserve lieutenant from East Texas who is among the most far-right lawmakers in the Texas House. \"This is going to take time. I don't believe that we can stand down while the federal government steps up. And that's going to be awhile.\" The state is set to pass a new budget by June, and just about every part of Texas government is in line to take hit: Public universities are fighting a proposed $300 million cut, and one of Abbott's biggest initiatives - bolstering pre-kindergarten - is also getting short shrift. More than $2 billion in proposed cost cuts to Medicaid is also on the table, and many state agencies are under a hiring freeze. The Senate spared border security from any cuts, and the House plan would also keep funding 50-hour workweeks on the border for nearly two dozen Texas Rangers and 250 troopers. The House only stopped short of purchasing new big-ticket defense items, such as more spy planes or armored boats to patrol the Rio Grande. State officials have defended the price tag by with data that include drug seizures and arrests, though critics question the numbers. Last year, an Associated Press review found that child support evaders and low-level felony drug arrests were among thousands of arrests being categorized as \"high-threat criminals\" along the border. Some think the real \"Trump effect\" was pushing fearful people to get to the U.S. before Trump took office. Border arrests in October, November and December increased by about a third compared to the same period in 2015, before falling this year. \"A lot of Republican members want to be able to say they voted for money on the border to stop this perceived immigration problem,\" said Rep. Chris Turner, who leads the House Democratic Caucus. \"The data doesn't support their arguments. A lot of us hoped there would be a lot less money would be put into border security. But politics is driving that decision.\" ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Paul J. Weber on Twitter: www.twitter.com/pauljweber",

The time-honored rituals of paying tribute a fallen law enforcement officer are supposed to offer comfort and they no doubt did comfort Clinton Greenwood's family and others who loved him. https://www.facebook.com/JohnDonnellyFOX26/videos/vb.317634238274293/1351342684903438/?type=2&theater\n\"He was my hero and he still is,\" said his Clinton's son Chuck Greenwood. \"He was not a quitter and he never stopped,\" explained Clinton's daughter Catherine Greenwood as she struggled to maintain her composure. \"And he would never let us pause our lives. I love you, Dad, and I'm so thankful that you were my father.\" https://www.facebook.com/fox26houston/videos/vb.203055485347/10155582324415348/?type=2&theater Speaker after speaker praised Clinton for the renaissance man he was -- a lawyer, law enforcement officer, marksman, father, husband and friend. While the service seemed like a typical funeral service for a fallen law enforcement officer, it wasn't. It was the first time that anyone could remember that that nobody is being held accountable for the murder as the person who caused so much grief remains free. https://www.facebook.com/fox26houston/videos/vb.203055485347/10155582014265348/?type=2&theater \"Clint was someone we could all count on,\" said Lieutenant Tim Cannon, a childhood friend and former coworker. \"It's time for him to count on us.\" https://www.facebook.com/JohnDonnellyFOX26/videos/vb.317634238274293/1351079088263131/?type=2&theater The Harris County Sheriff said while some tips and leads are coming in, not enough are. \"We want more. we've had some but not enough,\" said Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. \"As we say, all it takes for one phone call, somebody who saw something suspicious.\" That's why after the unusual memorial service, something even more unusual happened. The victim's widow stood before the assembled cameras and implored the public for help. https://www.facebook.com/fox26houston/videos/vb.203055485347/10155582221950348/?type=2&theater \"If anyone has any information about my husband's death, please come forward and report it,\" said Leatha Greenwood. \"Let us know everything.\" https://www.facebook.com/JohnDonnellyFOX26/videos/vb.317634238274293/1351383168232723/?type=2&theater",
