Use the camera to take a shot of the man leaning against the wall. You are going to use the camera frequently, throughout the game. After you take a shot, time will slow down and there will appear a white marker, above your character - it is a situation, in which Spider-Man senses danger. Use the mouse/analog stick to take a look around and locate the danger - you will notice a falling fragment of the crane, above your head. Press the action key, after which you will start a fight. The game will guide through the beginning of the fight. The basic thing here is to tap attack keys sufficiently fast and whenever you notice the red marker - dodge. After you land a blow, there will appear a combo meter on the left - the more blows you land without taking damage or escaping from the battle, the higher value will the meter reach. Thanks to this, you will be able to perform more powerful combos and you will reach the next experience level faster.",
