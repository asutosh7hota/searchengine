Verily! Allah knows what you do.\n\t\t﴾Sura 16 - Ayat 91﴿\n\n\nHe it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.\n\t\t﴾Sura 57 - Ayat 4﴿\n\n\nAnd hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allah's Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islamic Faith), and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allah makes His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.,) clear to you, that you may be guided.\n\t\t﴾Sura 3 - Ayat 103﴿\n\n\nTherefore remember Me (by praying, glorifying, etc.). I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless Favours on you) and never be ungrateful to Me.\n\t\t﴾Sura 2 - Ayat 152﴿\n\n\nAnd had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you (O Muhammad SAW) then compel mankind, until they become believers.\n\t\t﴾Sura 10 - Ayat 99﴿\n\n\nAnd let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, Al-Masakin (the poor), and those who left their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n\t\t﴾Sura 24 - Ayat 22﴿\n\n\nIs there any reward for good other than good?\n\t\t﴾Sura 55 - Ayat 60﴿\n\n\nShow forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don't punish them).\n\t\t﴾Sura 7 - Ayat 199﴿\n\n\nO you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former, nor defame one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. How bad is it, to insult one's brother after having Faith [i.e. to call your Muslim brother (a faithful believer) as: \"O sinner\", or \"O wicked\", etc.]. And whosoever does not repent, then such are indeed Zalimun (wrong-doers, etc.).\n\t\t﴾Sura 49 - Ayat 11﴿\n\n\nAllah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. \"Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Maula (Patron, Suppor-ter and Protector, etc.) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.\n\t\t﴾Sura 2 - Ayat 286﴿\n\n\nIt is He, Who has created for you (the sense of) hearing (ears), sight (eyes), and hearts (understanding). Little thanks you give.\n\t\t﴾Sura 23 - Ayat 78﴿\n\n\nSay (O Muhammad SAW to mankind): \"If you (really) love Allah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\"\n\t\t﴾Sura 3 - Ayat 31﴿\n\n\nAnd come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily! the covenant, will be questioned about.\n\t\t﴾Sura 17 - Ayat 34﴿\n\n\nWhen you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally. Certainly, Allah is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things.\n\t\t﴾Sura 4 - Ayat 86﴿\n\n\nIt is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allah, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the orphans, and to Al-Masakin (the poor), and to the wayfarer, and to those who ask, and to set slaves free, performs As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and gives the Zakat, and who fulfill their covenant when they make it, and who are As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.) in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al-Muttaqun (pious - see V. 2:2).\n\t\t﴾Sura 2 - Ayat 177﴿\n\n\nAllah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists. Neither slumber, nor sleep overtake Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great. [This Verse 2:255 is called Ayat-ul-Kursi.]\n\t\t﴾Sura 2 - Ayat 255﴿\n\n\nAnd perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salat (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins). That is a reminder (an advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice).\n\t\t﴾Sura 11 - Ayat 114﴿\n\n\nO you who believe! Avoid much suspicions, indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.\n\t\t﴾Sura 49 - Ayat 12﴿\n\n\nAllah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e. neither it gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e. nor it gets sun-rays only in the afternoon, but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allah guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.\n\t\t﴾Sura 24 - Ayat 35﴿\n\n\nAnd We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years give thanks to Me and to your parents, unto Me is the final destination.\n\t\t﴾Sura 31 - Ayat 14﴿\n\n\nThere is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.\n\t\t﴾Sura 2 - Ayat 256﴿\n\n\nAnd eat up not one another's property unjustly (in any illegal way e.g. stealing, robbing, deceiving, etc.), nor give bribery to the rulers (judges before presenting your cases) that you may knowingly eat up a part of the property of others sinfully.\n\t\t﴾Sura 2 - Ayat 188﴿\n\n\nAnd when We show favour to man, he withdraws and turns away, but when evil touches him, then he has recourse to long supplications.\n\t\t﴾Sura 41 - Ayat 51﴿\n\n\nAnd say (O Muhammad SAW): \"My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the Best of those who show mercy!\"\n\t\t﴾Sura 23 - Ayat 118﴿\n\n\nO you who believe! Seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer). Truly! Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.).\n\t\t﴾Sura 2 - Ayat 153﴿\n\n\nVerily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad SAW)] and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Beneficent (Allah) will bestow love for them (in the hearts of the believers).\n\t\t﴾Sura 19 - Ayat 96﴿\n\n\nInvite (mankind, O Muhammad SAW) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Inspiration and the Quran) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His Path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided.\n\t\t﴾Sura 16 - Ayat 125﴿\n\n\nVerily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad SAW)] and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Beneficent (Allah) will bestow love for them (in the hearts of the believers).\n\t\t﴾Sura 19 - Ayat 96﴿\n\n\nSo Glorified is He and Exalted above all that they associate with Him, and in Whose Hands is the dominion of all things, and to Him you shall be returned.\n\t\t﴾Sura 36 - Ayat 83﴿\n\n\nAnd when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad SAW) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.\n\t\t﴾Sura 2 - Ayat 186﴿\n\n\nVerily, Allah enjoins Al-Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but Allah Alone - Islamic Monotheism) and Al-Ihsan [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to Allah, totally for Allah's sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet SAW in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allah has ordered you to give them e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help, etc.): and forbids Al-Fahsha' (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right, etc.), and Al-Munkar (i.e. all that is prohibited by Islamic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds, etc.), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression), He admonishes you, that you may take heed.\n\t\t﴾Sura 16 - Ayat 90﴿\n\n\nThe good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allah ordered the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly), then verily! he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.\n\t\t﴾Sura 41 - Ayat 34﴿\n\n\nO mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. one of the Muttaqun (pious - see V. 2:2). Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.\n\t\t﴾Sura 49 - Ayat 13﴿\n\n\nAnd the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness.\n\t\t﴾Sura 25 - Ayat 63﴿\n\n\nSo whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it.\n\t\t﴾Sura 99 - Ayat 7﴿\n\n\nSo verily, with the hardship, there is relief,\n\t\t﴾Sura 94 - Ayat 5﴿\n\n\nYour Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is Ever Most Forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance.\n\t\t﴾Sura 17 - Ayat 25﴿\n\n\nThe creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind, yet most of mankind know not.\n\t\t﴾Sura 40 - Ayat 57﴿\n\n\nIs not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations. Is there any ilah (god) with Allah? Little is that you remember!\n\t\t﴾Sura 27 - Ayat 62﴿\n\n\nAnd whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds, then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance.\n\t\t﴾Sura 25 - Ayat 71﴿\n\n\nVerily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad SAW)] and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Beneficent (Allah) will bestow love for them (in the hearts of the believers).\n\t\t﴾Sura 19 - Ayat 96﴿\n\n\nO you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah and be just witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety, and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.\n\t\t﴾Sura 5 - Ayat 8﴿\n\n\n",
