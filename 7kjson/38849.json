      "text": "Herbalism is the ancient study of the medicinal properties of herbs. Countless herbs have been discovered throughout history that can help cure or alleviate various health problems. Among some of the better known herbs with medicinal properties are poppy - used for morphine, digitalis - used for heart medicine, willow - used to make aspirin, and canibis - used for pain relief. Countless other herbs have medicinal benefits as well - some more powerful than others. The most simple use of herbs is for teas (called infusion or decoctions by herbalists) and tinctures. An herbal infusion is made by pouring boiling water over the desired herb, allowing it to steep for several minutes, and drinking.  For harder herbal substances (such as roots), the herb is placed in boiling water and allowed to boil for several minutes in the kettle. Tinctures contain the medicinal substance of the herb disolved in a menstruum (fluid) typically consisting of a mixture of alcohol and water. Typically, a grain alcohol such as Everclear is used because of it's high alcohol content. However, vodka can also be used where Everclear is not commercially available.\n\nTo make a tincture, you need to know the ratio of herb to menstruum and the particular menstruum to use. Typically, this is represented by a ratio (such as 1:5) and an amount of alcohol (25A). This means That for every gram of herb you will need 5 grams of liquid and that the liquid should be 25% alcohol. You can use the menstruum calculator to determine the amounts of water and alcohol you need to make the proper menstruum for your tincture.  The ratio and alcohol amounts are listed in the herb details. Once you have mixed the herb and the menstruum, let the mixture sit for three weeks and shake daily. After the three weeks is up, strain all the herb from the liquid and bottle. The dossage for most herbs is one dropper in a small glass of water.\n\nFor many herbs, you can also make oils that can be applied externally to wounds or skin blemishes. To make an oil, cut up the herb into small pieces, place it in a mason jar, and cover the herb fully with olive oil. Let the mixture sit for a month (shaking daily) and then strain the herb and decant the oil from the water that will have separated. If you wish to keep the oil from turning rancid over time, add a perservative such as vitiman E into the oil. This oil can then be added to beeswax to make lip balm or to petroleum jelly to make a salve for the skin",
