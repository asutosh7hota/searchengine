      "text": "Legal Information about this application\n\n\nDate of Last Revision: Feb 29, 2012.\nDate of Last Revision: Aug 9, 2011.\n\nThis agreement was written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls for all the access from outside Japan and the Japanese version controls for all access from Japan.\n\nTerms of Service\n\nThis Statement of Terms of Service (Statement) derives from the TwitCasting Principles, and governs our relationship with users and others who interact with TwitCasting. By using or accessing TwitCasting, you agree to this Statement.\n\n\nSharing Your Content and Information\n\nYou own all of the content and information you post on TwitCasting, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:\n\n1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and account settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with TwitCasting (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.\n2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).\n3. When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the application.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.\n4. When you publish content or information, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of TwitCasting, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).\n5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about TwitCasting, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).\n\n\nSafety\n\nWe do our best to keep TwitCasting safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:\n1. You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on TwitCasting.\n2. You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access TwitCasting, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.\n3. You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on TwitCasting.\n4. You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.\n5. You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.\n6. You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.\n7. You will not post content that: is hateful, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.\n8. You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.\n9. You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (“promotion”) on TwitCasting.\n10. You will not use TwitCasting to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.\n11. You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of TwitCasting, such as a denial of service attack.\n12. You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.\n \n \nRegistration and Account Security\n\nTwitCasting users provide their valid account information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:\n\n1. You will not provide any false personal information on TwitCasting, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.\n2. You will not create more than one personal profile without any reasonable grounds.\n3. If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.\n4. You will not use your personal profile for your own commercial gain (such as selling your status update to an advertiser).\n5. You will not use TwitCasting if you are under 13.\n6. You will not use TwitCasting if you are a convicted sex offender.\n7. You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.\n8. You will not share your password, (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.\n9. You will not transfer your account (including any page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.\n10. If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).\n \n\nProtecting Other People's Rights\n\nWe respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.\n1. You will not post content or take any action on TwitCasting that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.\n2. We can remove any content or information you post on TwitCasting if we believe that it violates this Statement.\n3. We will provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights.\n4. If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.\n5. If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.\n6. You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including TwitCasting and TwitCasting Logos), or any confusingly similar marks, without our written permission.\n7. If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not TwitCasting) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.\n8. You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on TwitCasting.\n9. You will not mention users or send email to non-users without their consent.\n\n\nMobile\n\n1. We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging fees, will still apply.\n2. You provide all rights necessary to enable users to sync (including through an application) their notification lists with any basic information and contact information that is visible to them on TwitCasting, as well as your name and profile picture.\n\n\nPayments and Deals\n\nIf you make a payment on TwitCasting or use TwitCasting Credits, you agree to our Payments Terms.\n \n\nAmendments\n\nWe can change this Statement if we provide you notice by posting the change on the TwitCasting Site or TwitCasting Twitter/Facebook Page. To get notice of any future changes to this Statement, visit our TwitCasting Site.\nWe can make changes to this Statement at any time without prior notice.\n\n \nTermination\n\nIf you violate the letter or spirit of this Statement, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for us, we can stop providing all or part of TwitCasting to you. We will notify you on the web site at the next time you attempt to access your account. In all such cases, all the provisions of this Statement shall still apply.\n \n\nDisputes\n\nYou will resolve any claim, cause of action or dispute (claim) you have with us arising out of or relating to this Statement or TwitCasting exclusively in a court located in Tokyo Japan. The laws of Japan will govern this Statement, as well as any claim that might arise between you and us, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Tokyo, Japan for the purpose of litigating all such claims.\n\nIf anyone brings a claim against us related to your actions, content or information on TwitCasting, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) related to such claim.\n\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nWE TRY TO KEEP TWITCASTING UP, BUG-FREE, AND SAFE, BUT YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE ARE PROVIDING TWITCASTING AS IS WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

When you confirm a transaction on TwitCasting, you agree to be bound by and pay for that transaction.\n2. Pay attention to the details of the transaction, because your total price may include taxes, fees, and shipping costs, which you are responsible for paying.\n3. Don't commit to a transaction unless you are ready to pay, because all sales are final.\n4. If you order something that becomes unavailable before it can be provided to you, your only remedy is to receive a refund of your purchase price.\n5. When you purchase a virtual gift from our gift shop, we commit to posting the gift and any accompanying message from you on the recipient's profile (or sharing it privately if you choose). Our obligation ends when we deliver the gift and message.\n6. You may be presented with additional terms related to a specific purchase before you confirm the transaction (such as shipping terms for tangible goods). Those additional terms will also govern that transaction.\n7. Even though we use terms like purchase, buy, sell, and order to talk about transactions related to virtual gifts and credits, we don't transfer an ownership interest in those items. For example, the virtual gifts we make available through our gift shop are licensed to you, not sold.\n8. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD ON OR THROUGH TwitCasting.\n\n\nPayment Sources\n\n1. We want to make payments convenient, so we allow you to make payments using a number of different payment sources, like credit cards and debit cards. When you provide a payment source to us, you confirm that you are permitted to use that payment source. You also authorize us to collect and store it, along with other related transaction information.\n2. When you make a payment, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the payment source you designate for the transaction.\n3. If you pay by credit or debit card we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount up to the amount of the purchase. We will bill your card at the time of purchase or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, that pre-approval may result in your funds not otherwise being immediately available.\n4. If you pay by debit card and your payment results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.\n\n\nPurchasing and Using Credits\n\nYou may purchase credits from TwitCasting to purchase virtual goods, or to send gifts or special messages to other users.\n1. When you purchase or receive credits, you do not own the credits. Rather, you receive a limited right to use such credits in connection with certain features on TwitCasting, such as the purchase of a virtual gift.\n2. Except as otherwise stated, purchases of credits are non-refundable.\n3. You will not sell credits to anyone, or transfer them to anyone outside of TwitCasting.\n4. We may change the purchase price for credits at any time as well as the ways that you can use or transfer credits. We also reserve the right to stop issuing credits.\n5. Credits are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from us unless we agree otherwise in writing.\n6. If you leave a balance of credits unused for two years, we may redeem those credits by sending virtual gifts to your TwitCasting friends or donating the credits to a nonprofit organization of our choice (and charging standard redemption fees for those transactions).\n7. If you deactivate your account and do not reactivate it within 3 months, or if you delete your account, you will lose any accumulated credits.\n8. If we deactivate your account and you do not meet any conditions necessary to reinstate it within 6 months, we may redeem those credits by donating the credits to a nonprofit organization of our choice (and charging standard redemption fees for those transactions).\n9. If you receive free or promotional Credits, we may expire them at any time.\n\n\nActions We May Take\n\nAs part of our effort to keep TwitCasting safe, we may take certain actions to reduce liability for users and us.\n1. We may make any inquiries that we consider necessary, either directly or through third parties, concerning your identity and creditworthiness.\n2. We may cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates these Payments Terms or the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, or we believe doing so may prevent financial loss.\n3. We may place a delay on a payment for a period of time, limit payment sources for a transaction, limit your ability to make a payment or deactivate your account if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss.\n4. We may contact your payment source issuer, law enforcement, or impacted third parties (including other users) and share details of any payments you are associated with if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss or a violation of law.\n5. We may cancel any credits transferred, assigned, or sold in violation of these Payments Terms or the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.\n6. If you purchase advertising, and your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may take steps to collect past due amounts using other collection mechanisms. You agree to pay all expenses associated with such collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Interest will accrue on any past due amounts at the rate of the lesser of 1% per month or the lawful maximum.\n\n\nDisputes and Reversals\n\n1. If you believe that an unauthorized or otherwise problematic transaction has taken place under your account, you agree to notify us immediately, so that we may take action to prevent financial loss.\n2. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims against us related to payments unless you submit the claim to us within 30 days after the charge.\n3. You are responsible for and agree to reimburse us for all reversals, charge-backs, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by us (including costs and related expenses) that were caused by or arising out of payments that you authorized or accepted.\n4. If you enter into a transaction with a third party and have a dispute over the goods or services you purchased we have no liability for such goods or services. Our only involvement with regard to such transaction is as a payment agent.\n5. We may intervene in disputes between users concerning payments but have no obligation to do so.\nYour only remedy for a technical failure or interruption of service is to request that your transaction be completed at a later time.\n\n\nNotices and Amendments to These Payments Terms\n\n1. We may provide notices to you by posting them on our website. Website notices shall be considered received by you within 24 hours of the time posted.\n2. Except as otherwise stated, you must send notices to us relating to payments and these Payment Terms by postal mail to: Moi Corporation (sidefeed, Inc).\n3. The Payment Terms in place at the time you confirm a transaction will govern that transaction.\n4. We may change these Payment Terms, in whole or in part, even though the changes may affect accumulated credits.\n\n\nOther\n\n1. All of the commitments you make in the TwitCasting Statement of Terms of Service apply to payments through TwitCasting. In the event of any conflict between these Payments Terms and the TwitCasting Statement of Terms of Service, the Payments Terms shall prevail.\n2. If you are under the age of 18, you may make payments only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. You should review these Payments Terms with a parent or guardian to make sure that you both understand them.\n3. Some countries may restrict or prohibit your ability to make payments through TwitCasting. Nothing in these Payments Terms should be read to override or circumvent any such foreign laws.\n",
