The arbitrator agrees with my assessment that excessive force was used, and I stand by my decision to hold everyone in our department to the highest possible standards.\" RELATED: St. Paul arrest video evokes strong reaction  RELATED: 2 St. Paul officers suspended after violent arrest  RELATED: St. Paul officer in arrest video no longer with department  RELATED: Historically large settlement for man mauled by SPPD K-9 The June 24, 2016 arrest that led to Palkowitsch's termination was caught on dash cam. The video, which runs about a minute and a half, shows a group of officers running up to surround an African-American man, identified as 53-year-old Frank Baker, as he lay on the ground. While grainy and poor in quality, it is clear that a police dog is extensively and aggressively engaged with the man on the ground, and one officer is seen kicking the man at least three times.No gun was ever found on Baker. He spent 14 days in the hospital and suffered several broken ribs and two collapsed lungs as a result of the kicks. He underwent several extensive skin grafts on his legs and is now limited in his mobility due to the mauling.\"That dog is like your gun. Want to know why? Look what he did to me,\" Baker said in March of 2017. \"It's one of the worst things to ever happen to me in my life and I'm still having problems with it right now.\"Baker's attorney Andrew Noel says his client has agreed to a $2 million settlement with St. Paul.Officer Brian Ficcadenti, the handler of the K-9 involved in the incident, received a 30-day suspension for his role but was not fired. The arbitrator said in his report that the two officers should be treated the same for their misconduct, which he said was essentially the same.",

She was one of three people injured in an explosion of violence at a building on the 2600 block of Golden Valley Road early Sunday morning. One male suffered a minor gunshot wound, while another man was stabbed.  RELATED: 2 shot, 1 stabbed in overnight incident Neighbors say the building where the violence occurred houses a motorcycle club, and maintain things are normally quiet there. One witness said that was not the case early Sunday, when he heard between 30 and 60 shots ring out.Two men were arrested in the wake of the shooting, both on weapons charges, but Minneapolis Police are not saying whether either is linked to the now-fatal shooting. Anyone with information on the shooting or the suspects who may be responsible is asked to call homicide investigators at 612-692-8477. They can also text their tip in to 847411 (TIP411).  Enter MPD, a space, and then the information.  These text messages are assigned a tip number and the police department has no way of identifying the source of the information.  ",
