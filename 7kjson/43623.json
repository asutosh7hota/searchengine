If a Device, the software embedded in it (the “Software”), or if a Download, the application, including its embedded software (collectively, the “Application”) is owned by Garmin Ltd. or its subsidiaries (collectively, “Garmin”). The map data that may be embedded in your Device, the Application or downloaded separately (the “Map Data”) is owned by HERE North America LLC and/or its affiliates (“HERE”) and is licensed to Garmin. Garmin also owns, or licenses from third party providers, information, traffic data, text, images, graphics, photographs, audio, video, images and other applications and data that may be embedded in the Device or Application, or downloaded separately (“Other Content”). The Map Data and Other Content are collectively the “Content”. The Software, Application and Content (collectively, the “Garmin Products”) are protected under copyright laws and international copyright treaties. The Garmin Products are licensed, not sold. The structure, organization and code of the Software and Application are valuable trade secrets of Garmin and/or its third-party providers. The Garmin Products are each provided under this License Agreement and are subject to the following terms and conditions which are agreed to by End User (“you” or “your”), on the one hand, and Garmin and its licensors and affiliated companies of Garmin and its licensors, on the other hand. If you are obtaining the Application from a third party application vendor (the “Application Vendor”), you acknowledge that Garmin, and not the Application Vendor, is responsible for the Application. Garmin’s licensors, including the licensors, service providers, channel partners, suppliers and affiliated companies of Garmin and its licensors, are each a direct and intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce their rights directly against you in the event of your breach of this Agreement.\n\n IMPORTANT: CAREFULLY READ THIS ENTIRE LICENSE AGREEMENT BEFORE PURCHASING OR USING YOUR DEVICE OR DOWNLOADED APPLICATION OR CONTENT. PURCHASING, INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING YOUR DEVICE OR DOWNLOADED APPLICATION OR CONTENT INDICATES YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

Garmin grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to use the applicable Garmin Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use the applicable Garmin Product for solely personal use, or if applicable, for use in your business’ internal operations, and not for service bureau, time-sharing, resale or other similar purposes. Accordingly, but subject to the restrictions set forth in the following paragraphs, you may copy the applicable Garmin Product only as necessary for your use to (i) view it, and (ii) save it, provided that you do not remove any copyright notices that appear and do not modify the Garmin Product in any way. Your use of the Application must not violate any usage rules of the Application Vendor or any other third party service provider you use to enable the Application. You agree not to otherwise reproduce, archive, copy, modify, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or create derivative works of any portion of the Garmin Products, and may not transfer or distribute it in any form, for any purpose, except to the extent permitted by mandatory laws. Garmin also reserves the right to discontinue offering any Content supplied by any third party supplier if such supplier ceases to supply such content or Garmin’s contract with such supplier terminates for any reason.\n\n Support. If you purchased your Application from a third party application vendor and you need operational or technical support and assistance regarding the installation, un-installation, use or operation of the Application, or if you have questions, complaints or claims regarding the Application, contact Garmin at:mobileapplications.support@garmin.com.\n\n Acknowledgement of Application Vendor Responsibility. If you purchased your Application from a third party application vendor, the Application Vendor shall have no maintenance or support obligation for the Application, nor any responsibility for addressing any claims from you or any third party regarding the possession or use of the Application, including without limitation product liability claims, claims of failure to meet legal or regulatory requirements or consumer protection laws claims. Further, the Application Vendor shall have no responsibility regarding third party claims of intellectual property rights violations as a result of your possession or use of the Application.\n\n Restrictions. Except where you have been specifically licensed to do so by Garmin, and without limiting the preceding paragraphs, you may not use the Garmin Products with any products, systems, or applications installed or otherwise connected to or in communication with vehicles, and which are capable of dispatch, fleet management or similar applications where the Content is used by a central control center in dispatching a fleet of vehicles. In addition, you are prohibited from renting or leasing the Garmin Products to any other person or third party. Only those rental car companies that are specifically authorized by Garmin in writing to rent Garmin products containing the Content to their rental customers are permitted to rent out such products.\n\n You agree to be fully responsible for your own conduct and content while using the Software and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the Software only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with this Agreement and any applicable policies or guidelines. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using the Software, You will not:\n\n * upload, post, email or transmit or otherwise make available content that infringes any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right of any party, unless you are the owner of the rights or have the permission of the owner to post such Content; \n * use the Software or other content for any illegal or unauthorized purpose; or \n * transmit any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, or any items of a destructive nature. \n\n In the event that you are located outside of the United States, you agree to comply with any laws, rules or regulations in your locale or in the location of your web server regarding online conduct and acceptable content, including laws regulating the export of data to the United States or your country of residence.\n\n Data Transfer. Certain services in connection with the Application may result in a transfer of data from your device. In that case, additional charges for data transfer may arise, depending on your device data plan. Please contact your data provider for details about any additional charges.\n\n Garmin Live Services. Garmin may provide to you services known as “Garmin Live” services. Garmin Live services may be a “one-time” Live services purchase or a purchase for a specific term. If a “one-time” purchase is made, purchasers of that service will receive Garmin Live services for the (i) useful life of the purchaser’s Garmin device, (ii) the useful life of the purchaser’s smartphone (if applicable), or (iii) as long as Garmin receives Content from its third party content supplier, whichever of the three periods is shortest. A Garmin device’s “useful life” means the period during which the device (a) has the required technical capabilities to utilize the then-current Live services (including a Live services-compatible operating system) and (b) is capable of operating as intended without major repairs. A Garmin device will be deemed to be out of service and its useful life to be ended if no updates have been downloaded for such device for a period of 24 months or more. Garmin Live services content is not available for all areas. Garmin may terminate a Live services subscription immediately for violations of the Live services terms of use. Live services subscriptions may not be transferred to another person or another Garmin product, even if the application remains on the smartphone. Garmin Live Services are in part - depending on the service - geographically restricted to the reception and transmission range of the radio transmitters, operated by the respective network operators. They can be affected by atmospheric conditions, topographical conditions, the vehicles location or position as well as obstacles (for example bridges and buildings).Some services are generally not available in every country. The extent and characteristics of the available services differ from country to country. You are personally responsible for the compliance with the laws and regulations of the respective countries.\n\n Lifetime Maps. If you purchase a nüMapsTM Lifetime subscription (sold separately) or if your Garmin product comes bundled with a nüMaps Lifetime or other lifetime map subscription, you will receive Map Data updates when and as such updates are made available on Garmin’s website, during the useful life of one (1) compatible Garmin product or as long as Garmin receives Map Data from HERE, whichever is shorter.A product’s “useful life” means the period during which the product (a) has sufficient memory capacity and other required technical capabilities to utilize current map data and (b) is capable of operating as intended without major repairs. A product will be deemed to be out of service and its useful life to be ended if no updates have been downloaded for such product for a period of 24 months or more. Unless otherwise stated, the updates you receive under the subscription will be updates to the same geographic area included with your Garmin product when originally purchased. In some instances, your Garmin product might not have sufficient memory remaining for you to load an update to the Map Data, in which case you will need to either (a) select reduced Map Data coverage for your updates, or (b) purchase separately a microSD card or a SD card (if and as applicable to your Garmin product) and load all or a portion of the Map Data coverage for your updates to the card and insert the card into the microSD card or SD card slot contained in your Garmin product. If neither of the measures in (a) or (b) can be used to address your product’s lack of sufficient remaining memory, then Garmin may conclude that the “useful life” of your product has expired. Garmin may terminate your nüMaps Lifetime or other lifetime map subscription at any time if you violate any of the terms of this Agreement or your subscription. Your nüMaps Lifetime subscription or other lifetime map subscription may not be transferred to another person or another Garmin product.\n\n No Warranty. The Garmin Products are provided to you “as is,” and you agree to use them at your own risk. Garmin and its licensors including the licensors, service providers, channel partners and suppliers, and affiliated companies of Garmin and its licensors, make no guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, arising by law or otherwise, including but not limited to, content, quality, accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, reliability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, usefulness, use or results to be obtained from the Garmin Products, or that the Content or server will be uninterrupted or error-free. The Garmin Products are intended to be used only as supplementary travel aids and must not be used for any purpose requiring precise measurement of direction, distance, location or topography. GARMIN MAKES NO WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE MAP DATA OR OTHER CONTENT.\n\n Disclaimer of Warranty. GARMIN AND ITS LICENSORS, including the licensors, service providers, channel partners, suppliers and affiliated companies of Garmin and its licensors, DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you purchased your Application from a third party application vendor, THE SOLE AND MAXIMUM RESPONSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION VENDOR IN THE EVENT OF A WARRANTY FAILURE IS A REFUND OF THE APPLICATION PURCHASE PRICE.\n\n ANY CONTENT OR MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR UPLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE SOFTWARE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK.
