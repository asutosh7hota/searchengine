Please read them carefully. \"We\" and \"Sky Map Devs\" refers to the authors and contributors to the Sky Map codebase. \"The App\" refers to the Sky Map application. \n\nSummary\n\nSky Map comes with no warranties! If you choose to use it to navigate the high seas and you hit an iceberg, it's your responsibility. If you tell your kids that the bright thing in the sky is Jupiter and it turns out to be a UFO and you are subsequently kidnapped by aliens - not our responsibility. If your kids subsequently fail their science homework - not our responsibility. If it wipes all the data in your phone, including the photos of the UFO that were going to make you rich - not our responsibility. If it causes your phone to tear a hole in the fabric of space and time, OK - that one is on us. Any other calamities not listed above - not our responsibility. Don't use it while driving or carrying scissors. \n\nBoring legalese version follows. \n\nUsing Sky Map\n\nUsing Sky Map does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights over the content you access. You may not use content from Sky Map unless you obtain permission from its owners (see help/acknowledgments) or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in Sky Map. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with Sky Map. \n\nPrivacy\n\nOur privacy policy (see below) explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use Sky Map. By using Sky Map, you agree that we can use such data in accordance with our privacy policy. \n\nAbout Sky Map\n\nThis software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. The Sky Map Developers give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use Sky Map in the manner permitted by these terms. You may use the Sky Map source code in accordance with the license at https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid/blob/master/LICENSE.md .\nWe are constantly changing and improving Sky Map. We may add or remove features at any time, and we may stop supporting it or publishing it altogether. \n\nWarranties and Disclaimers\n\nWe are proud of Sky Map but we make no promises about it. Note the following:\nOTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER SKY MAP DEVS NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APP. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE APP, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APP, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE APP “AS IS”.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES. \n\nLiability for Sky Map\n\nWHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, SKY MAP DEVS, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF SKY MAP DEVS, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APP (i.e. nothing).\nIN ALL CASES, SKY MAP DEVS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE APP.\n\nBusiness uses of Sky Map\n\nIf you are using Sky Map on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Sky Map Devs from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.\n\nAbout these Terms\n\nWe may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to the App to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to Sky Map. These terms will show in the App again when we make modifications. If you do not agree to the modified terms you should discontinue your use of the app. If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict. If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThis App uses Google Analytics to help analyse how people use it. Google Analytics collects standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. Note that the data is anonymous - no personally identifiable information is collected. This anonymous information is transmitted to Google – not the Sky Map developers. Google Analytics then compiles statistical reports that tell us things like the percentage of users that use certain features, have particular versions of Android or have phones that have certain features (such as a gyroscope). This is essential for us to discover which features people like and dislike and when we can drop support for obsolete versions of Android and thus make Sky Map better. We might share these reports with third parties.\nWe respect your privacy and do not collect your personal information - we cannot tell anything about you as a user. If you do not wish to share this anonymous data with Google Analytics you can opt out via the settings menu. Otherwise, thank you for helping make Sky Map better.
