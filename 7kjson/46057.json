Then we did a manual shutdown,\" plant operations and maintenance manager Robert Waddle said.Even so, millions of gallons of sewage and storm water flowed into the plant and into Puget Sound.\"As director, I'm responsible for what happened at the plant and I'm responsible for fixing it,\" said Isaacson, who took the position in the fall.He reassured residents crews are restoring the plant, not just making repairs.\"Those float switches? We're replacing them. And we're looking at other ones that might need similar replacements,\" Isaacson said.Magnolia's Gretchen Taylor said she appreciated his taking responsibility, \"but gosh, accountability is still in question.\"\"I didn't feel satisfied that they have a sense of all of the scenarios that would prevent this in the future,\" Taylor said.While others at the meeting lined up with concerns about impact to beaches, wildlife and water, especially when the weather warms up.\"We're going to have photosynthesis going on, and we're going to have more nutrients in the water,\" Chris Wilke, executive director of Puget Sound Keeper, said.A county marine biologist addressed it: \"There are no increase in nutrients that we can see.\"The county says further monitoring is necessary, but first crews need to get the plant full operational. The goal is to complete this by April 30.Meeting goers questioned why it would take more than another month.Isaacson explained equipment that heats and decomposes solid waste are still not functional yet. At the moment, the secondary system that cleans out many solids is in abeyance because there is nowhere for the waste to go.",

Prolific Berry Continued To Make Music into his  90s  Just this past October, on his 90th birthday Berry announced plans to team with Dualtone Records to release his first studio album in 38 years next year.  Berry announced the new album, Chuck, on his 90th birthday. He said the album is dedicated to Themetta Berry, his wife of 68 years.\"This record is dedicated to my beloved Toddy,\" Berry said in a media release. \"My darlin' I'm growing old! I've worked on this record for a long time. Now I can hang up my shoes!\"  As more information becomes available, this story will be updated.",
