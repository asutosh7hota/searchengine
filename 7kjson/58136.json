          "text": "PALMER PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING, INC. END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT\n\nREAD THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. THE SOFTWARE COVERED BY THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT IS NOT FREE SOFTWARE.  WE ARE WILLING TO LICENSE OUR SOFTWARE TO YOU ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS IN THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT.\n\nThis End-User License Agreement (\"EULA\") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual person or a single legal entity, who will be referred to in this EULA as \"you\") and Palmer Performance Engineering, Inc. (\"PPE\") for the software technology that displays this EULA, including the executable code version of the software, all associated software and media, upgrades, updates, patches, plug-ins, supplemental applications, printed materials, files, data, documentation and online services provided by PPE, its affiliates and suppliers (the \"Product\").  The Product also includes any PPE created Skins distributed by PPE for use with the Product and any software updates, add-on components, web services and/or supplements provided to you or made available to you after the date you obtain the Product, to the extent that such items are not accompanied by a separate license agreement or terms of use. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, PPE is unwilling to license the Product. In such event, you may not install, copy, download or otherwise use the Product.\n\nBY CLICKING THE ACCEPTANCE BUTTON OR INSTALLING, COPYING, DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THIS PRODUCT, YOU ARE AGREEING ELECTRONICALLY TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE \"AGREEMENT\" or \"LICENSE\") AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS LICENSE, DO NOT CLICK THE ACCEPTANCE BUTTON OR INSTALL, COPY, DOWNLOAD, ACCESS, OR USE THE PRODUCT.\n \nThis Product is protected by copyright and is the sole property of PPE. This Product may not be duplicated, sold, distributed or utilized in any manner not described herein without the prior written consent of PPE. Parties interested in distributing or licensing the Product for other uses should contact PPE at sales@palmerperformance.com.\n\nThis Agreement applies to the Product provided by PPE, its affiliates and suppliers. BY CLICKING THE ACCEPTANCE BUTTON OR INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT, YOU ELECTRONICALLY AGREE ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT (IF APPLICABLE) THAT YOU AND SUCH ENTITY ARE BOUND BY, AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO, THIS AGREEMENT AS THE LICENSEE. YOU ALSO AGREE TO RECEIVE REQUIRED NOTICES, TERMS AND INFORMATION FROM PPE ELECTRONICALLY.\n\n1. LICENSE GRANT.\n\n      a) Use of the Product. Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PPE grants you a personal, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to install and use the Product on as many computers as you have purchased licenses for. PPE also grants you permission to create Skins for the Product by modifying the included Skin files, in accordance with any Product documentation. You may distribute the Skins you create, but you must rename the file distributed and may not use the Product name or any Product file name in the name of the Skin file you distribute.  For the purpose of this Agreement, \"Skin\" means a graphical interface for the Product that changes the look but not the functionality, and includes the files that define how the skin is built, and the graphics that create the visual look.\n\n\tb)  If you have legally acquired the Product for evaluation purposes, PPE licenses you to use the Product for testing and evaluation purposes only, without charge, for a period of 30 days, starting from the day you install the Product. Unregistered use of the Product after the 30 day evaluation period is a violation of U.S. and international copyright laws.\n\n\tc)  A registered copy of the Product may be installed on computers used by one single person only, or it may be installed on one computer used non-simultaneously by several persons, but NOT both. This is NOT a concurrent use license. You may not install the Product for access through any network, without first obtaining a license for each computer that will access the Product over that network, regardless of whether the Product is accessed concurrently or otherwise.\n\n2. RESTRICTIONS ON USE.  You may not: (i) modify or create any derivative works of the Product; (ii) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to (a) derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, structure or organization of the Product, or (b) defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate or otherwise circumvent any software protection mechanisms in the Product (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction); (iii) attempt to access or use the premium features of the Product if Licensee has not paid the applicable fees or by any manner or method other than using the license key provided by PPE; (iv) redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Product or rights thereto, including  any registration codes and license keys; (v) use the Product in a timesharing, service bureau, application service provider, or similar business arrangement; or (vi) remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in the Product. The PPE produced Skins that are provided with the Product may only be used with the PPE software products and may not be used with any other software or other third party product.\n\n3. TERMINATION.  Should Licensee breach this Agreement, Licensee's right to use the Product shall terminate immediately and without notice. The respective rights and obligations of PPE and Licensee under the provisions of Sections 3 (\"Restrictions on Use\"), 4 (\"Termination\"), 5 (\"Proprietary Rights\"), 6 (\"Indemnification\"), 8 (\"Limitation of Liability\") and 10 (\"Miscellaneous\") shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement and Licensee agrees to continue to be bound by those terms. Upon termination, Licensee shall destroy all copies of the Product.\n\n4. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.  Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the Product shall remain in PPE and/or its licensors and other suppliers. Licensee acknowledges such ownership and intellectual property rights and will not take any action to jeopardize, limit or interfere in any manner with PPE's or its licensors' or other suppliers' ownership of or rights with respect to the Product. The Product is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties. All trademarks used in connection with the Product are owned by PPE, its affiliates or its licensors and other suppliers, and no license to use any such trademarks is provided hereunder. Licensee agrees that PPE may use in any manner and without limitation all comments, suggestions, complaints and other feedback Licensee provides relating to the Product.  PPE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO ANONYMOUSLY TRACK AND TO REPORT YOUR ACTIVITY WITH REGARD TO THE PRODUCT, THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT USED, AND VEHICLE STATISTICS. This data will be collected anonymously, and used to modify, improve, and support future versions of the Product. No personal or identifying information about you or your vehicle will ever be collected or tracked.\n\n5. INDEMNIFICATION.  Licensee agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and at PPE's request, to defend PPE, its affiliates, licensors and suppliers from any and all costs, damages and reasonable attorneys' fees resulting from any breach of this Agreement or claim that Licensee's use of the Product has injured or otherwise violated any right of any third party or violates any law.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY FOR THE PRODUCT. THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED WITH ALL FAULTS ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. PPE, ITS LICENSORS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES THAT THE PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, VIRUS FREE, AND ABLE TO OPERATE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED BASIS, THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PRODUCT WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT ERRORS IN THE PRODUCT WILL BE CORRECTED, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT THE PRODUCT IS MERCHANTABLE, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURATE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NEED, OR NON-INFRINGING, UNLESS SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION. FURTHER, PPE, ITS LICENSORS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE PRODUCT IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY PPE OR A PPE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY WARRANTY THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. PPE AND ITS LICENSORS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCT. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE AND ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ANY SERVICE AND REPAIR. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO USE OF THE PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PPE OR ITS PRINCIPALS, SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS OR RESELLERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"PPE GROUP\") BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF, AND REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. IN ANY CASE, THE PPE GROUP'S ENTIRE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE SUM OF THE FEES PAID FOR THIS LICENSE (IF ANY) AND REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE MEDIA OR PROVISION OF A REASONABLY SIMILAR PRODUCT, AS DETERMINED AT PPE'S SOLE DISCRETION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF PPE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS THE LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN SUCH CASES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE PPE GROUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF: (i) CONTENT PROVIDED BY LICENSEE OR A THIRD PARTY THAT IS ACCESSED THROUGH OR USED WITH THE PRODUCT AND/OR ANY MATERIAL LINKED THROUGH SUCH CONTENT; OR (ii) THE USE OF PLUG-INS OR SKINS DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES AND MADE AVAILABLE ON PPE'S WEBSITE FOR USE WITH THE PRODUCT; OR (iii) ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY IMPROPER OR IMPRUDENT USE OF THE PRODUCT, INCLUDING USE WHILE DRIVING.\n\n8.  The Software contains features and functionality that may use the data connection of your computer or mobile device. Depending on your mobile data plan, you may be charged for data use by your mobile device carrier. While many mobile devices automatically disable data usage when roaming (using your mobile device outside your country or covered area of your carrier) or in other situations, if the data connection is active and you use the Software, it may result in even higher charges.  PPE is in no way responsible or liable for any and all charges you receive from your data plan provider by using the Software.\n\n9. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by you shall cause PPE irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate and that PPE therefore may obtain timely injunctive relief to protect its rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10. MISCELLANEOUS.  (a) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, which may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of PPE. (b) Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah, U.S.A., excluding any conflict of law provisions. (c) Licensee expressly agrees that jurisdiction for any claim or dispute relating to or arising out of this Agreement resides exclusively in the federal and state courts of the State of Utah and expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction thereof. (d) This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. (e) If any provision in this Agreement should be held illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent, or severed from this Agreement if no such modification is possible, and other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, or PPE may at its option instead terminate this Agreement. (f) A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, shall not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. (g) You may not assign or otherwise transfer by operation of law or otherwise this Agreement or any rights or obligations herein. PPE may assign this Agreement to any entity at its sole discretion. (h) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. (i) Neither party shall be in default or be liable for any delay, failure in performance (excepting the obligation to pay) or interruption of service resulting directly or indirectly from any cause beyond its reasonable control.  (j) This Agreement is the complete statement of the agreement and supersedes any proposal or prior communications between PPE and you relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and this Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of PPE.\n\nPPE reserves the right at any time not to release the Product or, if released, to change prices, specifications, features, licensing terms, release dates, general availability, or other characteristics of the release without further notification.  All rights of any kind in the Product that are not expressly granted in this License are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by PPE.\n",
