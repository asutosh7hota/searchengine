You must not disclose our confidential information to any third party without our written permission, unless required to do so by law. \r\nWe reserve the right to amend this Agreement (including the pricing) provided that we give you 28 days prior notice in writing, via email or on the Site.  If you receive notice of any amendment(s) to this Agreement, you may terminate this Agreement by giving us written notice within 14 days of the amendment(s) taking effect.
